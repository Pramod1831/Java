# Java

Hey! This repo contains my collection of Java programs and solutions. Most of these are from **LeetCode** practice and some personal projects Iâ€™ve worked on to strengthen my **problem-solving** and *Java* skills.

---

## About This Repo:
 
I) I practice coding to get better at algorithms and data structures.

II) Most of the problems are categorized by topic, like strings, arrays, and math.

III) This is also a way for me to track my progress and see how my solutions improve over time.

IV) Worked on Cryptographic related algorithms.

## Future Plans

I) Add more LeetCode solutions and categorize them by difficulty.

II) Include explanations or notes for tricky problems.

III) Keep improving code quality and readability.
